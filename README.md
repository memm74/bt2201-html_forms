# BT2201 Task HTML Forms

## Introduction

### Overview

Just like in last week's workshop you will add some content to a very basic html document. This week we work with form elements.

### Editing

#### The quick way...

If you like you can edit the document directly in GitHub's web interface. This is a very convenient way of editing the file. 

If you want to test your files (especially in the future when we've started using PHP) you should upload them to your web space on bimserver2.com. 

#### The preferred way...

The preferred way of working is to edit the files on your own machine. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can use GitHub Desktop or link your GitHub account to PHPStorm (there are many more ways but these two are very convenient).
* You then upload these files to bimserver2 for testing.
* You commit changes and push the commits to your GitHub account to create a history of the changes over time.
* You _can_ work on several machines and use commits as a way of keeping the files on different machines up to date. 

## Task

Below is today's task. You have to start this work in the 'forms.html' file. It can be found in the same repository as the readme document you are currently reading. You don't have to do all the work in one html file. If you want you can create additional files in your repository.

Add an HTML form that contains
* a text field
* a password field
* a text area
* a dropdown list
* radiobuttons
* checkboxes

The content of the elements, e.g. what text you put in the dropdown list, is up to you. 

* Add the final URL on bimserver2.com to the comment in line 2 
* Give the page(s) a meaningful title (`<title></title>`)
* Upload the file(s) to your area on bimserver2.com
* ☞Content, file and folder names (except links.html) are up to you

You are welcome to copy and paste HTML from these handouts, but the quotes might need changing from opening double quotes (“) and closing double quotes (”) to straight double quotes ("). 
 
Commit early, commit often - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit and there's a mistake in your file.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

Work on this task by yourself, not in groups.
